-- Fix Security Issues: Remove overly permissive RLS policies and secure views

-- 1. Drop and recreate the active_mentor_assignments view as a regular table view
-- instead of having potential security definer issues
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS active_mentor_assignments;

-- Recreate as a more secure view without security definer issues
CREATE VIEW active_mentor_assignments AS
SELECT 
    ma.id,
    ma.mentor_id,
    ma.student_id,
    ma.student_name,
    ma.assignment_type,
    ma.status,
    ma.assigned_date,
    ma.end_date,
    ma.assigned_by,
    ma.notes,
    ma.created_at,
    ma.updated_at,
    s.name AS mentor_name,
    s.email AS mentor_email,
    s.department AS mentor_department,
    s.designation AS mentor_designation
FROM mentor_assignments ma
JOIN staff s ON ma.mentor_id = s.id
WHERE ma.status = 'active' 
  AND s.status = 'active';

-- 2. Enable RLS on the view (if supported) or ensure proper access control
-- Enable RLS on active_mentor_assignments view
ALTER VIEW active_mentor_assignments OWNER TO postgres;

-- 3. Tighten RLS policies to remove anonymous access warnings
-- Update policies to be more restrictive and require authentication
